Life came to be
only when I saw it
but when I wasn't looking
it gradually grew into something better

Oh life, where did you come from?
how did I not see you form into existence
or remember how you were created?
maybe it was meant to be

Yet in a life that is told to
ignore things like that,
we ignore the wrong things
and hope for the best
